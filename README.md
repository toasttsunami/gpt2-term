## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a simplified version of GPT-2 that can be easily understood and modified. It includes:

- A PyTorch implementation of a small-scale GPT-2 model
- A character-level tokenizer
- A training loop for fine-tuning the model on custom text data
- A terminal application for interacting with the trained model

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, but recommended for faster training)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simplified-gpt2.git
   cd simplified-gpt2
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install torch
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your training data:
   - Create a text file containing the data you want to train the model on.
   - Update the `load_data('your_text_file.txt')` line in `gpt2_terminal_app.py` with your file's name.

2. Run the application:
   ```
   python gpt2_terminal_app.py
   ```

3. The model will train on your data. After training, you can enter prompts to generate text.

4. Type 'quit' to exit the application.

## File Structure

- `simplified_gpt2.py`: Contains the implementation of the GPT-2 model.
- `gpt2_terminal_app.py`: Contains the terminal application for training and text generation.
- `your_text_file.txt`: Your training data file (you need to provide this).

## Model Architecture

The simplified GPT-2 model includes:

- Token and position embeddings
- Multi-head self-attention layers
- Feedforward neural network layers
- Layer normalization

The default configuration uses:

- Vocabulary size: 256 (ASCII characters)
- Embedding dimension: 256
- Number of attention heads: 4
- Number of layers: 4
- Maximum sequence length: 100

## Training

The model is trained using:

- Adam optimizer
- Cross-entropy loss
- Batch size of 32
- Learning rate of 3e-4
- 10 epochs (configurable)

## Text Generation

Text generation uses a simple sampling strategy:

1. The model computes probabilities for the next token.
2. A token is randomly sampled based on these probabilities.
3. The process repeats until the specified length is reached or a newline character is generated.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the model and training process by modifying the hyperparameters at the beginning of `gpt2_terminal_app.py`:

- `VOCAB_SIZE`: Size of the vocabulary
- `EMBED_DIM`: Dimension of the embeddings
- `NUM_HEADS`: Number of attention heads
- `NUM_LAYERS`: Number of transformer layers
- `MAX_SEQ_LEN`: Maximum sequence length
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for training
- `LEARNING_RATE`: Learning rate for the Adam optimizer
- `NUM_EPOCHS`: Number of training epochs

## Limitations

- This is a simplified implementation and may not perform as well as the full GPT-2 model.
- The character-level tokenization is simple but less effective than more advanced tokenization methods.
- The model size is small compared to the original GPT-2, limiting its capacity to learn and generate high-quality text.

## Improvements

Here are some areas where this project could be improved:

1. Tokenization: Implement a more sophisticated tokenizer, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or SentencePiece.

2. Model size: Increase the model size (more layers, larger embedding dimension) to improve text generation quality.

3. Training data: Provide example datasets and scripts for data preprocessing.

4. Optimization: Implement gradient clipping and learning rate scheduling for more stable training.

5. Text generation: Add temperature control and top-k/top-p sampling for better text generation.

6. GPU utilization: Improve GPU memory usage to allow training larger models.

7. Evaluation: Add perplexity calculation and other metrics to evaluate model performance.

8. Checkpointing: Implement model saving and loading to resume training or use pre-trained models.

9. Documentation: Add more inline comments and improve function documentation.

10. Testing: Create unit tests for model components and the overall application.

11. Web interface: Develop a simple web interface as an alternative to the terminal application.

12. Distributed training: Implement data parallelism for training on multiple GPUs.

By addressing these improvements, the project can become more robust, efficient, and user-friendly while providing a better learning experience for those interested in understanding and experimenting with GPT-2 style models.
